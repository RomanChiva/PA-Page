Our proposed approach couples agent motion prediction and planning to avoid the freezing robot problem while simultaneously capturing multi-agent social interactions by utilizing a state-of-the-art trajectory prediction model i.e., social long short-term memory model (Social-LSTM). Leveraging the output of Social-LSTM for the prediction of future trajectories of pedestrians at each time-step given the robot’s possible actions, our framework computes the optimal control action using Model Predictive Control (MPC) for the robot to navigate among pedestrians. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in multiple scenarios of simulated crowd navigation and compare it against several state-of-the-art reinforcement learning-based methods.},

This paper aims to review the existing approaches and theories to help understand and rethink the interactions among human drivers toward social autonomous driving. We take this survey to seek the answers to a series of fundamental questions: 1) What is social interaction in road traffic scenes? 2) How to measure and evaluate social interaction? 3) How to model and reveal the process of social interaction? 4) How do human drivers reach an implicit agreement and negotiate smoothly in social interaction? This paper reviews various approaches to modeling and learning the social interactions between human drivers, ranging from optimization theory and graphical models to social force theory and behavioral \& cognitive science. We also highlight some new directions, critical challenges, and opening questions for future research.},

	abstract = {In this article, we propose a nonlinear receding horizon game-theoretic planner for autonomous cars in competitive scenarios with other cars. The online planner is speciﬁcally formulated for a multiple-car autonomous racing game, in which each car tries to advance along a given track as far as possible with respect to the other cars. The algorithm extends previous work on game-theoretic planning for single-integrator agents to be suitable for autonomous cars in the following ways: 1) by representing the trajectory as a piecewise polynomial; 2) incorporating bicycle kinematics into the trajectory; and 3) enforcing constraints on path curvature and acceleration. The game-theoretic planner iteratively plans a trajectory for the ego vehicle and then the other vehicles in sequence until convergence. Crucially, the trajectory optimization includes a sensitivity term that allows the ego vehicle to reason about how much the other vehicles will yield to the ego vehicle to avoid collisions. The resulting trajectories for the ego vehicle exhibit rich game strategies such as blocking, faking, and opportunistic overtaking. The game-theoretic planner is shown to signiﬁcantly outperform a baseline planner using model-predictive control, which does not take interaction into account. The performance is validated in high-ﬁdelity numerical simulations with three cars, in experiments with two small-scale autonomous cars, and in experiments with a full-scale autonomous car racing against a simulated vehicle (video is available at https://youtube.com/ playlist?list=PLmIcLEh8KMje4rYBqRANDuKvqFvj7LCRp).},

	abstract = {Many autonomous agents, such as intelligent vehicles, are inherently required to interact with one another. Game theory provides a natural mathematical tool for robot motion planning in such interactive settings. However, tractable algorithms for such problems usually rely on a strong assumption, namely that the objectives of all players in the scene are known. To make such tools applicable for ego-centric planning with only local information, we propose an adaptive model-predictive game solver, which jointly infers other players’ objectives online and computes a corresponding generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) strategy. The adaptivity of our approach is enabled by a differentiable trajectory game solver whose gradient signal is used for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of opponents’ objectives. This differentiability of our pipeline facilitates direct integration with other differentiable elements, such as neural networks (NNs). Furthermore, in contrast to existing solvers for cost inference in games, our method handles not only partial state observations but also general inequality constraints. In two simulated trafﬁc scenarios, we ﬁnd superior performance of our approach over both existing game-theoretic methods and nongame-theoretic model-predictive control (MPC) approaches. We also demonstrate our approach’s real-time planning capabilities and robustness in two hardware experiments.},

	abstract = {Predicting the future states of surrounding traffic participants and planning a safe, smooth, and socially compliant trajectory accordingly are crucial for autonomous vehicles (AVs). There are two major issues with the current autonomous driving system: the prediction module is often separated from the planning module, and the cost function for planning is hard to specify and tune. To tackle these issues, we propose a differentiable integrated prediction and planning (DIPP) framework that can also learn the cost function from data. Specifically, our framework uses a differentiable nonlinear optimizer as the motion planner, which takes as input the predicted trajectories of surrounding agents given by the neural network and optimizes the trajectory for the AV, enabling all operations to be differentiable, including the cost function weights. The proposed framework is trained on a large-scale real-world driving dataset to imitate human driving trajectories in the entire driving scene and validated in both open-loop and closed-loop manners. The open-loop testing results reveal that the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods across a variety of metrics and delivers planning-centric prediction results, allowing the planning module to output trajectories close to those of human drivers. In closed-loop testing, the proposed method outperforms various baseline methods, showing the ability to handle complex urban driving scenarios and robustness against the distributional shift. Importantly, we find that joint training of planning and prediction modules achieves better performance than planning with a separate trained prediction module in both open-loop and closed-loop tests. Moreover, the ablation study indicates that the learnable components in the framework are essential to ensure planning stability and performance.

	abstract = {Automated driving has the potential to revolutionize personal, public, and freight mobility. Besides the enormous challenge of perception, i.e. accurately perceiving the environment using available sensor data, automated driving comprises planning a safe, comfortable, and efficient motion trajectory. To promote safety and progress, many works rely on modules that predict the future motion of surrounding traffic. Modular automated driving systems commonly handle prediction and planning as sequential separate tasks. While this accounts for the influence of surrounding traffic on the ego-vehicle, it fails to anticipate the reactions of traffic participants to the ego-vehicle’s behavior. Recent works suggest that integrating prediction and planning in an interdependent joint step is necessary to achieve safe, efficient, and comfortable driving. While various models implement such integrated systems, a comprehensive overview and theoretical understanding of different principles are lacking. We systematically review state-of-the-art deep learning-based prediction, planning, and integrated prediction and planning models. Different facets of the integration ranging from model architecture and model design to behavioral aspects are considered and related to each other. Moreover, we discuss the implications, strengths, and limitations of different integration methods. By pointing out research gaps, describing relevant future challenges, and highlighting trends in the research field, we identify promising directions for future research.},

	abstract = {Predicting the motion of multiple agents is necessary for planning in dynamic environments. This task is challenging for autonomous driving since agents (e.g., vehicles and pedestrians) and their associated behaviors may be diverse and inﬂuence one another. Most prior work have focused on predicting independent futures for each agent based on all past motion, and planning against these independent predictions. However, planning against independent predictions can make it challenging to represent the future interaction possibilities between different agents, leading to sub-optimal planning. In this work, we formulate a model for predicting the behavior of all agents jointly, producing consistent futures that account for interactions between agents. Inspired by recent language modeling approaches, we use a masking strategy as the query to our model, enabling one to invoke a single model to predict agent behavior in many ways, such as potentially conditioned on the goal or full future trajectory of the autonomous vehicle or the behavior of other agents in the environment. Our model architecture employs attention to combine features across road elements, agent interactions, and time steps. We evaluate our approach on autonomous driving datasets for both marginal and joint motion prediction, and achieve state of the art performance across two popular datasets. Through combining a scene-centric approach, agent permutation equivariant model, and a sequence masking strategy, we show that our model can unify a variety of motion prediction tasks from joint motion predictions to conditioned prediction.},

However, existing methods do not consider the actual probability of collision for the planned trajectory, but rather its marginalization, that is, the independent collision probabilities for each planning step and/or dynamic obstacle, resulting in conservative trajectories. To address this issue, we introduce a novel real-time capable method termed Safe Horizon MPC, that explicitly constrains the joint probability of collision with all obstacles over the duration of the motion plan. This is achieved by reformulating the chance-constrained planning problem using scenario optimization and predictive control. Our method is less conservative than state-of-the-art approaches, applicable to arbitrary probability distributions of the obstacles’ trajectories, computationally tractable and scalable.

For conditional prediction, we introduce a query-centric Transformer model that performs efficient ego-conditioned motion prediction. For planning cost, we propose a learnable context-aware cost function with latent interaction features, facilitating differentiable joint learning. We validate our proposed approach using the real-world nuPlan dataset and its associated planning test platform. Our frame- work not only matches state-of-the-art planning methods but outperforms other learning-based methods in planning quality, while operating more efficiently in terms of runtime.

	abstract = {In highly interactive driving scenarios, the actions
of one agent greatly influences those of its neighbors. Planning safe motions for autonomous vehicles in such interactive envi- ronments, therefore, requires reasoning about the impact of the ego’s intended motion plan on nearby agents’ behavior. Deep- learning-based models have recently achieved great success in trajectory prediction and many models in the literature allow for ego-conditioned prediction. However, leveraging ego-conditioned prediction remains challenging in downstream planning due to the complex nature of neural networks, limiting the planner structure to simple ones, e.g., sampling-based planner. Despite their ability to generate fine-grained high-quality motion plans, it is difficult for gradient-based planning algorithms, such as model predictive control (MPC), to leverage ego-conditioned prediction due to their iterative nature and need for gradient. We present Interactive Joint Planning(IJP) that bridges MPC with learned prediction models in a computationally scalable manner to provide us the best of both the worlds. In particular, IJP jointly optimizes over the behavior of the ego and the surrounding agents and leverages deep-learned prediction models as prediction priors that the join trajectory optimization tries to stay close to. Furthermore, by leveraging homotopy classes, our joint optimizer searches over diverse motion plans to avoid getting stuck at local minima. Closed-loop simulation result shows that IJP significantly outperforms the baselines that are either without joint optimization or running sampling-based planning.},

	abstract = {Balancing safety and efﬁciency when planning in crowded scenarios with uncertain dynamics is challenging where it is imperative to accomplish the robot’s mission without incurring any safety violations. Typically, chance constraints are incorporated into the planning problem to provide probabilistic safety guarantees by imposing an upper bound on the collision probability of the planned trajectory. Yet, this results in overly conservative behavior on the grounds that the gap between the obtained risk and the speciﬁed upper limit is not explicitly restricted. To address this issue, we propose a real-time capable approach to quantify the risk associated with planned trajectories obtained from multiple probabilistic planners, running in parallel, with different upper bounds of the acceptable risk level. Based on the evaluated risk, the least conservative plan is selected provided that its associated risk is below a speciﬁed threshold. In such a way, the proposed approach provides probabilistic safety guarantees by attaining a closer bound to the speciﬁed risk, while being applicable to generic uncertainties of moving obstacles. We demonstrate the efﬁciency of our proposed approach, by improving the performance of a stateof-the-art probabilistic planner, in simulations and experiments using a mobile robot in an environment shared with humans.},

We are motivated in this work by the example of trafﬁc weaving, e.g., at highway onramps/off-ramps, where entering and exiting cars must swap lanes in a short distance—a challenging negotiation even for experienced drivers due to the inherent multimodal uncertainty of who will pass whom. Our approach is to learn multimodal probability distributions over future human actions from a dataset of human-human exemplars and perform real-time robot policy construction in the resulting environment model through massively parallel sampling of human responses to candidate robot action sequences. Direct learning of these distributions is made possible by recent advances in the theory of conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs), whereby we learn action distributions simultaneously conditioned on the present interaction history, as well as candidate future robot actions in order to take into account response dynamics. We demonstrate the efﬁcacy of this approach with a human-in-theloop simulation of a trafﬁc weaving scenario.},

Unfortunately, building HD maps has proven hard to scale due to their cost as well as the requirements they impose in the localization system that has to work everywhere with centimeter-level accuracy. Being able to drive without an HD map would be very beneﬁcial to scale self-driving solutions as well as to increase the failure tolerance of existing ones (e.g., if localization fails or the map is not up-to-date). Towards this goal, we propose MP3, an end-to-end approach to mapless1 driving where the input is raw sensor data and a high-level command (e.g., turn left at the intersection). MP3 predicts intermediate representations in the form of an online map and the current and future state of dynamic agents, and exploits them in a novel neural motion planner to make interpretable decisions taking into account uncertainty. We show that our approach is signiﬁcantly safer, more comfortable, and can follow commands better than the baselines in challenging long-term closed-loop simulations, as well as when compared to an expert driver in a large-scale real-world dataset.},

This paper presents an integrated behavioral inference and decision-making approach that models vehicle behavior for both our vehicle and nearby vehicles as a discrete set of closedloop policies that react to the actions of other agents. Each policy captures a distinct high-level behavior and intention, such as driving along a lane or turning at an intersection. We ﬁrst employ Bayesian changepoint detection on the observed history of states of nearby cars to estimate the distribution over potential policies that each nearby car might be executing. We then sample policies from these distributions to obtain high-likelihood actions for each participating vehicle. Through closed-loop forward simulation of these samples, we can evaluate the outcomes of the interaction of our vehicle with other participants (e.g., a merging vehicle accelerates and we slow down to make room for it, or the vehicle in front of ours suddenly slows down and we decide to pass it). Based on those samples, our vehicle then executes the policy with the maximum expected reward value. Thus, our system is able to make decisions based on coupled interactions between cars in a tractable manner. This work extends our previous multipolicy system [11] by incorporating behavioral anticipation into decision-making to evaluate sampled potential vehicle interactions. We evaluate our approach using real-world trafﬁc-tracking data from our autonomous vehicle platform, and present decision-making results in simulation involving highway trafﬁc scenarios.},

	abstract = {The actions of an autonomous vehicle on the road affect and are affected by those of other drivers, whether overtaking, negotiating a merge, or avoiding an accident. This mutual dependence, best captured by dynamic game theory, creates a strong coupling between the vehicle’s planning and its predictions of other drivers’ behavior, and constitutes an open problem with direct implications on the safety and viability of autonomous driving technology. Unfortunately, dynamic games are too computationally demanding to meet the real-time constraints of autonomous driving in its continuous state and action space. In this paper, we introduce a novel game-theoretic trajectory planning algorithm for autonomous driving, that enables real-time performance by hierarchically decomposing the underlying dynamic game into a long-horizon “strategic” game with simpliﬁed dynamics and full information structure, and a short-horizon “tactical” game with full dynamics and a simpliﬁed information structure. The value of the strategic game is used to guide the tactical planning, implicitly extending the planning horizon, pushing the local trajectory optimization closer to global solutions, and, most importantly, quantitatively accounting for the autonomous vehicle and the human driver’s ability and incentives to inﬂuence each other. In addition, our approach admits non-deterministic models of human decisionmaking, rather than relying on perfectly rational predictions. Our results showcase richer, safer, and more effective autonomous behavior in comparison to existing techniques.},

	abstract = {Autonomous navigation in dense trafﬁc scenarios remains challenging for autonomous vehicles (AVs) because the intentions of other drivers are not directly observable and AVs have to deal with a wide range of driving behaviors. To maneuver through dense trafﬁc, AVs must be able to reason how their actions affect others (interaction model) and exploit this reasoning to navigate through dense trafﬁc safely. This paper presents a novel framework for interaction-aware motion planning in dense trafﬁc scenarios. We explore the connection between human driving behavior and their velocity changes when interacting. Hence, we propose to learn, via deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), an interaction-aware policy providing global guidance about the cooperativeness of other vehicles to an optimization-based planner ensuring safety and kinematic feasibility through constraint satisfaction. The learned policy can reason and guide the local optimization-based planner with interactive behavior to pro-actively merge in dense trafﬁc while remaining safe in case the other vehicles do not yield. We present qualitative and quantitative results in highly interactive simulation environments (highway merging and unprotected left turns) against two baseline approaches, a learning-based and an optimization-based method. The presented results demonstrate that our method signiﬁcantly reduces the number of collisions and increases the success rate with respect to both learning-based and optimization-based baselines.},

Local trajectory optimization methods, such as model predictive control (MPC), can deal with those changes but require global guidance, which is not trivial to obtain in crowded scenarios. This letter proposes to learn, via deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), an interaction-aware policy that provides long-term guidance to the local planner. In particular, in simulations with cooperative and non-cooperative agents, we train a deep network to recommend a subgoal for the MPC planner. The recommended subgoal is expected to help the robot in making progress towards its goal and accounts for the expected interaction with other agents. Based on the recommended subgoal, the MPC planner then optimizes the inputs for the robot satisfying its kinodynamic and collision avoidance constraints. Our approach is shown to substantially improve the navigation performance in terms of number of collisions as compared to prior MPC frameworks, and in terms of both travel time and number of collisions compared to deep RL methods in cooperative, competitive and mixed multiagent scenarios.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a data-driven decentralized trajectory optimization approach for multi-robot motion planning in dynamic environments. When navigating in a shared space, each robot needs accurate motion predictions of neighboring robots to achieve predictive collision avoidance. These motion predictions can be obtained among robots by sharing their future planned trajectories with each other via communication. However, such communication may not be available nor reliable in practice. In this paper, we introduce a novel trajectory prediction model based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) that can learn multi-robot motion behaviors from demonstrated trajectories generated using a centralized sequential planner. The learned model can run efﬁciently online for each robot and provide interaction-aware trajectory predictions of its neighbors based on observations of their history states. We then incorporate the trajectory prediction model into a decentralized model predictive control (MPC) framework for multi-robot collision avoidance. Simulation results show that our decentralized approach can achieve a comparable level of performance to a centralized planner while being communication-free and scalable to a large number of robots. We also validate our approach with a team of quadrotors in real-world experiments.},

A collaborative robot’s motion must be legible, or intent-expressive. Legibility is often described in the literature as and effect of predictable, unsurprising, or expected motion. Our central insight is that predictability and legibility are fundamentally different and often contradictory properties of motion. We develop a formalism to mathematically deﬁne and distinguish predictability and legibility of motion. We formalize the two based on inferences between trajectories and goals in opposing directions, drawing the analogy to action interpretation in psychology. We then propose mathematical models for these inferences based on optimizing cost, drawing the analogy to the principle of rational action. Our experiments validate our formalism’s prediction that predictability and legibility can contradict, and provide support for our models. Our ﬁndings indicate that for robots to seamlessly collaborate with humans, they must change the way they plan their motion.},

Predictable motion matches an observer’s expectation which, during navigation, allows others to confidently carryout the interaction. In this work, we present a navigation framework capable of reasoning on its legibility and predictability with respect to dynamic interactions, e.g., a passing side. Our approach generalizes the previously formalized notions of legibility and predictability by allowing dynamic goal regions in order to navigate in dynamic environments. This generalization also allows us to quantitatively evaluate the legibility and the predictability of trajectories with respect to navigation interactions. Our approach is shown to promote legible behavior in ambiguous scenarios and predictable behavior in unambiguous scenarios. In a multi-agent environment, this yields an increase in safety while remaining competitive in terms of goal-efficiency when compared to other robot navigation planners in multi-agent environments.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14023},
	abstract = {Predicting accurate future trajectories of multiple agents is essential for autonomous systems but is challenging due to the complex interaction between agents and the uncertainty in each agent’s future behavior. Forecasting multiagent trajectories requires modeling two key dimensions: (1) time dimension, where we model the inﬂuence of past agent states over future states; (2) social dimension, where we model how the state of each agent affects others. Most prior methods model these two dimensions separately, e.g., ﬁrst using a temporal model to summarize features over time for each agent independently and then modeling the interaction of the summarized features with a social model. This approach is suboptimal since independent feature encoding over either the time or social dimension can result in a loss of information. Instead, we would prefer a method that allows an agent’s state at one time to directly affect another agent’s state at a future time. To this end, we propose a new Transformer, termed AgentFormer, that simultaneously models the time and social dimensions. The model leverages a sequence representation of multi-agent trajectories by ﬂattening trajectory features across time and agents. Since standard attention operations disregard the agent identity of each element in the sequence, AgentFormer uses a novel agent-aware attention mechanism that preserves agent identities by attending to elements of the same agent differently than elements of other agents. Based on AgentFormer, we propose a stochastic multi-agent trajectory prediction model that can attend to features of any agent at any previous timestep when inferring an agent’s future position. The latent intent of all agents is also jointly modeled, allowing the stochasticity in one agent’s behavior to affect other agents. Extensive experiments show that our method substantially improves the state of the art on wellestablished pedestrian and autonomous driving datasets.},

	abstract = {Our goal is to enable robots to produce motion that is suitable for human–robot collaboration and coexistence. Most motion in robotics is purely functional, ideal when the robot is performing a task in isolation. In collaboration, however, the robot’s motion has an observer, watching and interpreting the motion. In this work, we move beyond functional motion, and introduce the notion of an observer into motion planning, so that robots can generate motion that is mindful of how it will be interpreted by a human collaborator. We formalize predictability and legibility as properties of motion that naturally arise from the inferences in opposing directions that the observer makes, drawing on action interpretation theory in psychology. We propose models for these inferences based on the principle of rational action, and derive constrained functional trajectory optimization techniques for planning motion that is predictable or legible. Finally, we present experiments that test our work on novice users, and discuss the remaining challenges in enabling robots to generate such motion online in complex situations.},

	abstract = {The inclusion of social and human-like behaviors is recently emphasized within mobile robot locomotion. These behaviors are required to support the seamless integration of mobile robots into environments which they share with humans. This work demonstrates a distinct beneﬁt of these behaviors, which goes beyond positive apperception. It is shown that human-like robot locomotion reduces the planning effort for all agents within an environment. This effect is revealed in an experiment that compares human locomotion during avoidance of an oncoming human or wheeled robot. In order to evaluate recorded data, a framework for the analysis of human trajectories is proposed. Conﬁdence intervals based on a spline regression model are used to account for variance in the data. This qualitative method is complemented by a comparative analysis, that quantiﬁes differences and analogies within the data. Thus, the framework allows for a statistically feasible qualitative and quantitative analysis of trajectories. Results show, that extra planning effort for the avoidance is prevented by readable human-like robot locomotion. The study indicates that locomotion planning requires less effort from subjects if the mutual trajectory prediction is facilitated by robots that externalize intentions and comply with human-like behaviors.},

	abstract = {This paper reports on a data-driven motion planning approach for interaction-aware, socially-compliant robot navigation among human agents. Autonomous mobile robots navigating in workspaces shared with human agents require motion planning techniques providing seamless integration and smooth navigation in such. Smooth integration in mixed scenarios calls for two abilities of the robot: predicting actions of others and acting predictably for them. The former requirement requests trainable models of agent behaviors in order to accurately forecast their actions in the future, taking into account their reaction on the robot’s decisions. A human-like navigation style of the robot facilitates other agents—most likely not aware of the underlying planning technique applied—to predict the robot motion vice versa, resulting in smoother joint navigation. The approach presented in this paper is based on a feature-based maximum entropy model and is able to guide a robot in an unstructured, real-world environment. The model is trained to predict joint behavior of heterogeneous groups of agents from onboard data of a mobile platform. We evaluate the beneﬁt of interaction-aware motion planning in a realistic public setting with a total distance traveled of over 4 km. Interestingly the motion models learned from human-human interaction did not hold for robot-human interaction, due to the high attention and interest of pedestrians in testing basic braking functionality of the robot.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the safe navigation of a mobile robot through crowds of dynamic agents with uncertain trajectories. Existing algorithms suffer from the “freezing robot” problem: once the environment surpasses a certain level of complexity, the planner decides that all forward paths are unsafe, and the robot freezes in place (or performs unnecessary maneuvers) to avoid collisions. Since a feasible path typically exists, this behavior is suboptimal. Existing approaches have focused on reducing the predictive uncertainty for individual agents by employing more informed models or heuristically limiting the predictive covariance to prevent this overcautious behavior. In this work, we demonstrate that both the individual prediction and the predictive uncertainty have little to do with the frozen robot problem. Our key insight is that dynamic agents solve the frozen robot problem by engaging in “joint collision avoidance”: They cooperatively make room to create feasible trajectories. We develop IGP, a nonparametric statistical model based on dependent output Gaussian processes that can estimate crowd interaction from data. Our model naturally captures the non-Markov nature of agent trajectories, as well as their goal-driven navigation. We then show how planning in this model can be efﬁciently implemented using particle based inference. Lastly, we evaluate our model on a dataset of pedestrians entering and leaving a building, ﬁrst comparing the model with actual pedestrians, and ﬁnd that the algorithm either outperforms human pedestrians or performs very similarly to the pedestrians. We also present an experiment where a covariance reduction method results in highly overcautious behavior, while our model performs desirably.},

While prior work has studied how agents can gather information about the intent of others, in this work we study the inverse problem: how agents can demonstrate their intent to others, within the framework of general-sum dynamic games. We first present a model of this intent demonstration problem and then propose an algorithm that enables an agent to trade off their task performance and intent demonstration to improve the overall system’s performance. To scale to continuous states and action spaces as well as to nonlinear dynamics and costs, our algorithm leverages linear-quadratic approximations with an efficient intent teaching guarantee. Our empirical results show that intent demonstration accelerates other agents’ learning and enables the demonstrating agent to balance task performance with intent expression.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, autonomous cars make predictions about other drivers’ future trajectories, and plan to stay out of their way. This tends to result in defensive and opaque behaviors. Our key insight is that an autonomous car’s actions will actually affect what other cars will do in response, whether the car is aware of it or not. Our thesis is that we can leverage these responses to plan more efﬁcient and communicative behaviors. We model the interaction between an autonomous car and a human driver as a dynamical system, in which the robot’s actions have immediate consequences on the state of the car, but also on human actions. We model these consequences by approximating the human as an optimal planner, with a reward function that we acquire through Inverse Reinforcement Learning. When the robot plans with this reward function in this dynamical system, it comes up with actions that purposefully change human state: it merges in front of a human to get them to slow down or to reach its own goal faster; it blocks two lanes to get them to switch to a third lane; or it backs up slightly at an intersection to get them to proceed ﬁrst. Such behaviors arise from the optimization, without relying on hand-coded signaling strategies and without ever explicitly modeling communication. Our user study results suggest that the robot is indeed capable of eliciting desired changes in human state by planning using this dynamical system.},

On one hand, MPC is a well-established optimal control method, which uses the predicted future information to optimize the control actions while explicitly considering constraints. On the other hand, AGVs are able to make forecasts and adapt their decisions in uncertain environments. Therefore, because of the nature of MPC and the requirements of AGVs, it is intuitive to apply MPC algorithms to AGVs. AGVs are interesting not only for considering them alone, which requires centralized control approaches, but also as groups of AGVs that interact and communicate with each other and have their own controller onboard. This calls for distributed control solutions. First, a short introduction into the basic theoretical background of centralized and distributed MPC is given. Then, it comprehensively reviews MPC applications for both single and multiple AGVs. Finally, the paper highlights existing issues and future research directions, which will promote the development of MPC schemes with high performance in AGVs.},

The method leverages Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes to estimate the behavior of other trafﬁc participants given the planned trajectory for the ego-vehicle, and Receding-Horizon Control for generating safe trajectories for the ego-vehicle. To achieve safe navigation we introduce chance constraints over multiple motion policies in the recedinghorizon planner. These constraints account for uncertainty over the behavior of other trafﬁc participants. The method is capable of running in real-time and we show its performance and good scalability in simulated multi-vehicle intersection scenarios.},

In recent years many complex approaches based on neural networks have been proposed to address this problem. In this work we show that – surprisingly – a simple Constant Velocity Model can outperform even state-of-the-art neural models. This indicates that either neural networks are not able to make use of the additional information they are provided with, or that this information is not as relevant as commonly believed. Therefore, we analyze how neural networks process their input and how it impacts their predictions. Our analysis reveals pitfalls in training neural networks for pedestrian motion prediction and clariﬁes false assumptions about the problem itself. In particular, neural networks implicitly learn environmental priors that negatively impact their generalization capability, the motion history of pedestrians is irrelevant and interactions are too complex to predict. Our work shows how neural networks for pedestrian motion prediction can be thoroughly evaluated and our results indicate which research directions for neural motion prediction are promising in future.},

This paper introduces ALGAMES (Augmented Lagrangian GAME-theoretic Solver), a solver that handles trajectory optimization problems with multiple actors and general nonlinear state and input constraints. Its novelty resides in satisfying the ﬁrst order optimality conditions with a quasi-Newton root-ﬁnding algorithm and rigorously enforcing constraints using an augmented Lagrangian formulation. We evaluate our solver in the context of autonomous driving on scenarios with a strong level of interactions between the vehicles. We assess the robustness of the solver using Monte Carlo simulations. It is able to reliably solve complex problems like ramp merging with three vehicles three times faster than a state-of-the-art DDP-based approach. A model predictive control (MPC) implementation of the algorithm demonstrates real-time performance on complex autonomous driving scenarios with an update frequency higher than 60 Hz.},

	abstract = {Autonomous vehicle (AV) stacks are typically built in a modular fashion, with explicit components performing detection, tracking, prediction, planning, control, etc. While modularity improves reusability, interpretability, and generalizability, it also suffers from compounding errors, information bottlenecks, and integration challenges. To overcome these challenges, a prominent approach is to convert the AV stack into an end-to-end neural network and train it with data. While such approaches have achieved impressive results, they typically lack interpretability and reusability, and they eschew principled analytical components, such as planning and control, in favor of deep neural networks. To enable the joint optimization of AV stacks while retaining modularity, we present DiffStack, a differentiable and modular stack for prediction, planning, and control. Crucially, our model-based planning and control algorithms leverage recent advancements in differentiable optimization to produce gradients, enabling optimization of upstream components, such as prediction, via backpropagation through planning and control. Our results on the nuScenes dataset indicate that end-to-end training with DiffStack yields substantial improvements in open-loop and closed-loop planning metrics by, e.g., learning to make fewer prediction errors that would affect planning. Beyond these immediate benefits, DiffStack opens up new opportunities for fully data-driven yet modular and interpretable AV architectures. Project website: https://sites.google.com/view/diffstack},

	abstract = {Being aware of mutual influences between individuals is a major requirement a robot to efficiently operate in human populated environments. This is especially true for the navigation among humans with its mutual avoidance maneuvers. While humans easily manage this task, robotic systems are still facing problems. Most of the recent approaches concentrate on predicting the motions of humans individually and deciding afterwards. Thereby, interactivity is mostly neglected. In this work, we go one step back and focus on understanding the underlying principle of human decision making in the presence of multiple humans. Non-cooperative game theory is applied to formulate the problem of predicting the decisions of multiple humans that interact which each other during navigation. Therefore, we use the theory of Nash equilibria in static and dynamic games where different cost functions from literature rate the payoffs of the individual humans. The approach anticipates collisions and additionally reasons about several avoidance maneuvers of all humans. For the evaluation of the game theoretic approach we recorded trajectories of humans passing each other. The evaluation shows that game theory is able to reproduce the decision process of humans more accurately than a decision model that predicts humans individually.},

	abstract = {Rational choice theory enjoys unprecedented popularity and influence in the behavioral and social sciences, but it generates intractable problems when applied to socially interactive decisions. In individual decisions, instrumental rationality is defined in terms of expected utility maximization. This becomes problematic in interactive decisions, when individuals have only partial control over the outcomes, because expected utility maximization is undefined in the absence of assumptions about how the other participants will behave. Game theory therefore incorporates not only rationality but also common knowledge assumptions, enabling players to anticipate their co-players' strategies. Under these assumptions, disparate anomalies emerge. Instrumental rationality, conventionally interpreted, fails to explain intuitively obvious features of human interaction, yields predictions starkly at variance with experimental findings, and breaks down completely in certain cases. In particular, focal point selection in pure coordination games is inexplicable, though it is easily achieved in practice; the intuitively compelling payoff-dominance principle lacks rational justification; rationality in social dilemmas is self-defeating; a key solution concept for cooperative coalition games is frequently inapplicable; and rational choice in certain sequential games generates contradictions. In experiments, human players behave more cooperatively and receive higher payoffs than strict rationality would permit. Orthodox conceptions of rationality are evidently internally deficient and inadequate for explaining human interaction. Psychological game theory, based on nonstandard assumptions, is required to solve these problems, and some suggestions along these lines have already been put forward.},

	abstract = {Although dynamic games provide a rich paradigm for modeling agents' interactions, solving these games for real-world applications is often challenging. Many real-world interactive settings involve general nonlinear state and input constraints that couple agents' decisions with one another. In this work, we develop an efficient and fast planner for interactive trajectory optimization in constrained setups using a constrained game-theoretical framework. Our key insight is to leverage the special structure of agents' objective and constraint functions that are common in multi-agent interactions for fast and reliable planning. More precisely, we identify the structure of agents' cost and constraint functions under which the resulting dynamic game is an instance of a constrained dynamic potential game. Constrained dynamic potential games are a class of games for which instead of solving a set of coupled constrained optimal control problems, a constrained Nash equilibrium, i.e. a Generalized Nash equilibrium, can be found by solving a single constrained optimal control problem. This simplifies constrained interactive trajectory optimization significantly. We compare the performance of our method in a navigation setup involving four planar agents and show that our method is on average 20 times faster than the state-of-the-art. We further provide experimental validation of our proposed method in a navigation setup involving two quadrotors carrying a rigid object while avoiding collisions with two humans.},

Thus, only key aspects are typically described in scientific publications, making it impossible to reproduce results - yet, re-producibility is an important asset of good science. Composable benchmarks for motion planning on roads (CommonRoad) are proposed so that numerical experiments are fully defined by a unique ID; all information required to reconstruct the experiment can be found on the CommonRoad website. Each benchmark is composed by a vehicle model, a cost function, and a scenario (including goals and constraints). The scenarios are partly recorded from real traffic and partly hand-crafted to create dangerous situations. We hope that CommonRoad saves researchers time since one does not have to search for realistic parameters of vehicle dynamics or realistic traffic situations, yet provides the freedom to compose a benchmark that fits one's needs.},

	abstract = {The prediction of other road users is an essential task in autonomous driving for preventing collisions and enabling dynamic trajectory planning. This task becomes even more complex because different road users have different driving behaviors. There are underlying intentions that cannot be predicted with certainty without direct communication. In the current state of the art, most promising pattern-based models are trained on a dataset and then applied in the real world. In this paper we present an algorithm for vehicle trajectory prediction that is using online learning. The algorithm uses observations during the inference to optimize the underlying neural network at runtime. We show that our model can adapt to an observed behavior and thus improve the predicted uncertainty of trajectory predictions. Furthermore, we emphasize that our online learning approach can be transferred to many problems in self-supervised learning. The code used in this research is available as open-source software: https://github.com/TUMFTM/Wale-Net},

	abstract = {With the rise of artificial intelligence and automation, moral decisions that were formerly the preserve of humans are being put into the hands of algorithms. In autonomous driving, a variety of such decisions with ethical implications are made by algorithms for behaviour and trajectory planning. Therefore, here we present an ethical trajectory planning algorithm with a framework that aims at a fair distribution of risk among road users. Our implementation incorporates a combination of five ethical principles: minimization of the overall risk, priority for the worst-off, equal treatment of people, responsibility and maximum acceptable risk. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ethical algorithm for trajectory planning of autonomous vehicles in line with the 20 recommendations from the European Union Commission expert group and with general applicability to various traffic situations. We showcase the ethical behaviour of our algorithm in selected scenarios and provide an empirical analysis of the ethical principles in 2,000 scenarios. The code used in this research is available as open-source software.},

	abstract = {Autonomous cars allow safe driving with a smaller headway than that required for normal human-driven cars, thereby potentially improving road capacity. To attain this capacity benefit, cooperation among autonomous cars is vital. However, the future market may have multiple car brands and the incentive for them to cooperate is unknown. This paper investigates the compe­ tition and cooperation between multiple car brands that, may provide both autonomous and normal vehicles. We develop a two-stage game-theoretic model to investigate brands’ strategic interactions and evaluate, from both policy and organizational perspectives, the implications of their cooperation incentives and pricing competition. We compare four market structures: duopoly competition, perfect competition, a public welfare-maximizing monopoly, and a private profit-maximizing monopoly. Various parameters are evaluated, including factors such as the capacity benefits from cooperation, cooperation cost and price elasticity. This evaluation provides policy insights into actions that could be considered by regulators and organizations for the operation of autonomous cars.},
